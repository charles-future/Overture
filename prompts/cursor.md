# Overture Integration for Cursor

You have access to **Overture**, an MCP server that visualizes your execution plans as interactive flowcharts before you write any code.

## Why Overture Exists

Every AI coding agent shares the same fundamental problem: the developer types a prompt, you start working, and they have **no visibility** into what you're planning. By the time they realize you went in the wrong direction, you've already written 200+ lines of code that needs to be discarded.

**Overture solves this by making your plan visible, editable, and approvable before execution begins.**

## When to Use Overture

**USE** Overture for any task involving:
- Multiple steps or files to create/modify
- Architectural decisions the user should weigh in on
- User configuration (API keys, preferences, settings)
- Complex implementations with multiple valid approaches
- Tasks where getting alignment upfront saves significant rework

**DO NOT USE (Except if the user explicitity asks you to)** Overture for:
- Simple questions or explanations
- Single-file, small edits
- Quick bug fixes with obvious solutions
- Research or exploration tasks


---

## Consistency

These rules are mandatory and must never be broken:

- **ONE NODE EXECUTION AT A TIME**: Only one node must be executed at a time. Going forward and executing the next or several nodes ahead of time is strictly prohibited.
- **CORRELATION TO OVERALL GOAL AND CONTINUATION OF PREVIOUS NODES**: While working on one node, implementation must stay correlated to the overall goal and continue smoothly from previous nodes. Example: if the overall goal is a portfolio and this node is the hero section, build a portfolio hero section (not a generic one), and continue prior styling patterns (spacing, visual language, and flow) so the result is cohesive.

## Critical: Extended Planning Mode

**Your plans must be comprehensive, deeply detailed, and broken down to the atomic level.**

Unlike simple 5-10 step outlines, Overture expects you to generate **fully decomposed plans** where every task is broken into its smallest meaningful units. This is not optional — thorough planning prevents wasted tokens, wasted time, and developer frustration.

### Planning Requirements

For every task you receive, your plan must include:

1. **Atomic Decomposition**: Break every task into its smallest executable steps
2. **Rich Node Details**: Every node needs title, description, complexity, expected output, and risks
3. **Branch Points**: When multiple valid approaches exist, create separate task nodes for each option and connect them from a common parent node
4. **Dynamic Fields**: Declare any inputs needed from the user (API keys, config, preferences)
5. **Logical Dependencies**: Edges should reflect true execution order

### The Golden Rule: ONE COMPONENT = ONE NODE

**NEVER combine multiple components or features into a single node.** Each UI component, each API endpoint, each configuration step gets its own dedicated node.

### Example: Good vs. Bad Planning

**BAD PLAN (lazy, combined steps - DO NOT DO THIS):**
```
1. Set up project
2. Build the frontend
3. Add backend API
4. Deploy
```

**GOOD PLAN (atomic decomposition - THIS IS WHAT WE WANT):**

If a user asks for "a landing page," your plan should NOT just say "build a landing page." It should include:

```
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme
3. Create Header component
   - Logo placement and sizing
   - Navigation items with responsive menu
   - Dark mode toggle
4. Create Hero section
   - Headline and subheadline copy
   - CTA button with hover states
   - Background gradient/image
   - Entrance animations
5. Create Features section
   - Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
   - Feature card component
   - Icon selection for each feature
6. Create Testimonials section
   - Testimonial card component
   - Avatar, name, role, quote
7. Create Pricing section
   - Monthly/Annual toggle
   - PricingCard component
   - Feature comparison list
8. Create Footer component
   - Link groups
   - Newsletter signup form
   - Social media icons
9. Create Contact form
   - Form fields (name, email, message)
   - Validation logic
   - Submit handler
10. Add SEO meta tags and Open Graph
11. Configure deployment (Vercel/Netlify)
    - Environment variables
    - Build configuration
```

**Notice:** Each component (Header, Hero, Features, Footer, etc.) is its **own separate node**. Do NOT combine "Header, Hero, and Footer" into one "Build UI components" node.

Each of these becomes a node on the visual canvas with full details.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Input | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `submit_plan` | `{ plan_xml, workspace_path?, agent_type? }` | Submit complete XML plan |
| `stream_plan_chunk` | `{ xml_chunk, workspace_path?, agent_type? }` | Stream XML incrementally |
| `get_approval` | `{ project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Wait for user approval (may return "pending" — call again) |
| `update_node_status` | `{ node_id, status, output?, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Update execution progress |
| `plan_completed` | `{ project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Mark plan done |
| `plan_failed` | `{ error, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Mark plan failed |
| `check_rerun` | `{ timeout_ms?, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Check if user wants to re-run nodes (call after plan_completed) |
| `check_pause` | `{ wait?, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Check if user paused execution (call before each node) |
| `get_resume_info` | `{ project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Get state info for resuming a paused/failed plan |
| `request_plan_update` | `{ operations, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Apply incremental updates to the plan (insert, delete, replace) |
| `create_new_plan` | `{ project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Signal you're creating a new unrelated plan (adds alongside existing) |
| `get_node_info` | `{ node_id, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Get detailed information about a specific node |
| `update_node_detail` | `{ node_id, updates, project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Update a single node's details (title, description, etc.) |
| `update_nodes_detail` | `{ updates[], project_id?, workspace_path? }` | Batch update multiple nodes' details |

### Multi-Project Support

Overture supports multiple projects running simultaneously. Each project gets its own tab in the UI.

- **`workspace_path`**: Pass the absolute path to your project directory when calling ANY Overture tool. This enables:
  - Project isolation (separate history per folder)
  - Local `.overture.json` storage in your project
  - Consistent project tracking across all operations
- **`agent_type`**: Identify yourself (e.g., "cursor") so the UI shows the correct agent name.
- **`project_id`** / **`expected_project_id`**: **CRITICAL** - These are returned in the response from `submit_plan`. **YOU MUST use this exact value** in ALL subsequent calls (`get_approval`, `update_node_status`, `plan_completed`, etc.). The frontend uses this ID to match your approval request.

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Call submit_plan({ plan_xml, workspace_path: "/path/to/project" })
2. Response: { success: true, projectId: "84393059027d", expected_project_id: "84393059027d" }
3. Call get_approval({ project_id: "84393059027d", workspace_path: "/path/to/project" })
4. Call update_node_status({ node_id: "n1", status: "active", project_id: "84393059027d", workspace_path: "/path/to/project" })
5. Call update_node_status({ node_id: "n1", status: "completed", output: "...", project_id: "84393059027d", workspace_path: "/path/to/project" })
6. Call plan_completed({ project_id: "84393059027d", workspace_path: "/path/to/project" })
```

If you don't pass `workspace_path`, Overture uses a default project which works fine for single-project scenarios.

### Updating an Existing Plan

When the user requests changes to an existing plan, use `request_plan_update` with an array of operations:

**Supported operations:**
- `insert_after` - Insert a node after a reference node
- `insert_before` - Insert a node before a reference node
- `delete` - Delete a node (edges auto-reconnect)
- `replace` - Replace a node's content in-place

**Example:**
```json
request_plan_update({
  "operations": [
    {
      "op": "insert_after",
      "reference_node_id": "node_api",
      "node": {
        "id": "node_test",
        "type": "task",
        "title": "Run unit tests",
        "description": "Execute test suite"
      }
    },
    { "op": "delete", "node_id": "node_deploy" },
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "node_id": "node_5",
      "node": { "title": "Updated title", "description": "Updated description" }
    }
  ]
})
```

After calling `request_plan_update`, call `get_approval()` to confirm changes.

### Creating a New Unrelated Plan

If the user asks for something completely unrelated to the current plan (e.g., "forget that, let's build X instead"):

1. **Call `create_new_plan`** — This clears the current plan state
2. **Call `submit_plan`** with the new plan XML
3. **Call `get_approval`** to wait for user approval
4. Proceed with execution once approved

**Example workflow:**
```
1. User: "Actually, let's work on the authentication system instead"
2. You call: create_new_plan({ project_id })
3. You call: submit_plan({ plan_xml: "<new auth system plan>" })
4. You call: get_approval({ project_id })
5. Execute nodes as normal
```

### Node Information and Updates

These tools allow you to query and modify node details programmatically during execution.

#### get_node_info

Retrieve detailed information about a specific node, including all user-configured values.

**Parameters:**
- `node_id` (required): The ID of the node to query
- `project_id` (optional): Project ID (uses current project if not specified)

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "node": {
    "id": "n1",
    "title": "Initialize Project",
    "type": "task",
    "status": "pending",
    "description": "Set up the project structure",
    "complexity": "low",
    "expectedOutput": "package.json and project files created",
    "risks": "None significant",
    "fieldValues": { "project_name": "my-app" },
    "attachments": [{ "path": "/path/to/spec.md", "name": "spec.md", "type": "document" }],
    "mcpServers": [],
    "metaInstructions": "Use TypeScript strict mode",
    "isBranchPoint": false,
    "branchTargetIds": [],
    "selectedBranchId": null,
    "branchSourceId": null,
    "output": null
  },
  "projectId": "84393059027d"
}
```

**When to use:**
- When you need to check a node's current state before taking action
- When resuming execution and you need full node context
- When you need to verify what fieldValues or attachments are configured

#### update_node_detail

Update a single node's metadata during execution. The UI updates in real-time.

**Parameters:**
- `node_id` (required): The ID of the node to update
- `updates` (required): Object containing fields to update
  - `title` (optional): New title for the node
  - `description` (optional): New description
  - `complexity` (optional): "low" | "medium" | "high"
  - `expectedOutput` (optional): Updated expected output
  - `risks` (optional): Updated risks
- `project_id` (optional): Project ID

**Example:**
```json
update_node_detail({
  "node_id": "n3",
  "updates": {
    "title": "Configure PostgreSQL Database",
    "description": "Set up PostgreSQL with connection pooling based on user's database URL",
    "complexity": "medium"
  }
})
```

**When to use:**
- When you discover during execution that a node's description needs clarification
- When the actual implementation differs from the original plan
- When you want to add more detail to a node based on what you learned

#### update_nodes_detail

Batch update multiple nodes at once. More efficient than calling `update_node_detail` multiple times.

**Parameters:**
- `updates` (required): Array of update objects, each containing:
  - `node_id` (required): The ID of the node to update
  - `title` (optional): New title
  - `description` (optional): New description
  - `complexity` (optional): "low" | "medium" | "high"
  - `expectedOutput` (optional): Updated expected output
  - `risks` (optional): Updated risks
- `project_id` (optional): Project ID

**Example:**
```json
update_nodes_detail({
  "updates": [
    {
      "node_id": "n3",
      "title": "Updated: Configure Database",
      "complexity": "high"
    },
    {
      "node_id": "n4",
      "description": "Now using Prisma ORM instead of raw SQL"
    },
    {
      "node_id": "n5",
      "risks": "API rate limiting may apply - added retry logic"
    }
  ]
})
```

**When to use:**
- When multiple nodes need updates based on discoveries during execution
- When refining the plan after partial execution
- When you need to update node details efficiently in bulk

## Branching Rules (Graph-Based Branch Detection)

Branches are **inferred from the graph structure**, not declared explicitly. When a node has multiple outgoing edges, it becomes a branch point.

### How Branches Work

1. **Branch Detection**: When a node has multiple outgoing edges (e.g., `n1 -> n2_a` and `n1 -> n2_b`), the system detects it as a branch point
2. **Branch Options**: The target nodes (`n2_a`, `n2_b`) become the branch options displayed to the user
3. **User Selection**: The UI shows a "Select Branch" requirement. User clicks to see options and selects one
4. **Execution**: Only the selected branch path is executed; unselected branches are skipped

### Rule 1: Each branch option is a real task node
Branch options are full task nodes with their own title, description, and work to perform:
```xml
<!-- Branch Option A -->
<node id="n2_a" type="task" status="pending">
  <title>Option A: Use Tailwind CSS</title>
  <description>Set up styling with Tailwind CSS utility classes</description>
  <pros>Fast development, consistent design, small bundle size</pros>
  <cons>HTML can get verbose with many utility classes</cons>
  <complexity>low</complexity>
</node>

<!-- Branch Option B -->
<node id="n2_b" type="task" status="pending">
  <title>Option B: Use CSS Modules</title>
  <description>Set up styling with scoped CSS modules</description>
  <pros>Clean HTML, full CSS control, familiar syntax</pros>
  <cons>More files to manage, slower iteration</cons>
  <complexity>low</complexity>
</node>
```

### Rule 2: Use edges to create branches
Connect multiple edges from the same source node to create a branch point:
```xml
<edges>
  <!-- n1 branches to n2_a and n2_b - user must select one -->
  <edge id="e1" from="n1" to="n2_a" />
  <edge id="e2" from="n1" to="n2_b" />
</edges>
```

### Rule 3: Branches can converge
After branch-specific tasks, connect all branches to a common next step:
```xml
<!-- Common task after all branches -->
<node id="n3" type="task">
  <title>Continue with styling</title>
</node>

<edge from="n2_a" to="n3" />
<edge from="n2_b" to="n3" />
```

### Rule 4: Include pros and cons on branch options
Add `<pros>` and `<cons>` directly on branch option nodes to help users decide:
```xml
<node id="n2_postgres" type="task" status="pending">
  <title>Set up PostgreSQL</title>
  <pros>ACID compliance, complex queries, strong ecosystem</pros>
  <cons>Requires server setup, more complex scaling</cons>
</node>
```

## Dynamic Field Types

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `string` | Text input | Project name, domain, usernames |
| `secret` | Sensitive data (masked input) | API keys, tokens, passwords |
| `select` | Choice from options (use `options="a,b,c"`) | Framework choice, environment |
| `boolean` | Yes/No toggle | Enable TypeScript? Use strict mode? |
| `number` | Numeric input | Port number, timeout value |
| `question` | User question with optional dropdown | Preference questions, requirements |
| `color` | Color picker with hex input | Theme color, brand color |

**Always include `setup_instructions`** for fields requiring external values (API keys, credentials).

### Question Field Examples

```xml
<!-- Question with dropdown options -->
<dynamic_field
  id="q1"
  type="question"
  name="preferred_database"
  title="Which database do you prefer?"
  description="Select your preferred database"
  options="PostgreSQL,MySQL,MongoDB,SQLite"
  required="true"
/>

<!-- Question with free-form text input (no options) -->
<dynamic_field
  id="q2"
  type="question"
  name="custom_requirement"
  title="Any specific requirements?"
  description="Describe your requirements"
/>
```

### Color Field Example

```xml
<dynamic_field
  id="c1"
  type="color"
  name="theme_color"
  title="Theme Color"
  description="Choose your brand color"
  value="#3b82f6"
  required="true"
/>
```

## CRITICAL: Node-by-Node Execution (DO NOT OVER-IMPLEMENT)

**YOU MUST ONLY IMPLEMENT THE CURRENT NODE.** This is non-negotiable.

When you receive a node (via `firstNode` from `get_approval` or `nextNode` from `update_node_status`), you must:

### DO:
- **ONLY** implement what is described in that specific node's `title` and `description`
- **CONSUME ALL** fields in `fieldValues` — every single one must be used
- **READ AND USE ALL** files in `attachments` — do not ignore any attached file
- **FOLLOW EXACTLY** the `metaInstructions` if present — these are user directives
- **USE THE MCP SERVER** as specified in `mcpServers.formattedInstructions` if present
- **RESPECT** the node's `complexity`, `expectedOutput`, and `risks`

### DO NOT:
- Implement tasks from future nodes
- "Get ahead" by doing work not specified in the current node
- Skip any field, attachment, or instruction in the current node
- Assume what comes next — wait for the next node
- Add features or functionality not explicitly in the node description

### Why This Matters

Each node is a contract. The user approved a specific plan with specific nodes. If you over-implement:
- You break the visual progress tracking (nodes won't match actual work)
- You may contradict decisions the user will make in future nodes
- You waste tokens on work that might need to be redone
- You violate the user's trust in the plan they approved

### Checklist Before Completing a Node

Before calling `update_node_status(node_id, "completed", output)`, verify:
- [ ] **Did I check for `mcpServers` FIRST?** (If present, did I install it if needed?)
- [ ] **Did I USE the `mcpServers` tools** as specified in `formattedInstructions`? (if present)
- [ ] Did I implement ONLY what this node's description specified?
- [ ] Did I use EVERY value in `fieldValues`?
- [ ] Did I read and incorporate EVERY file in `attachments`?
- [ ] Did I follow the `metaInstructions` exactly?
- [ ] Did I NOT do any work belonging to other nodes?
- [ ] **Did I format the output using structured XML?** (See Structured Output Format in overture-instructions.md)

## Structured Output Format

When completing a node, you can provide structured XML output that will be rendered in a rich, expandable UI. This is **optional** but **recommended** for better user experience.

### XML Schema

```xml
<execution_output>
  <!-- Summary of what was accomplished (required) -->
  <overview>Brief description of what was done in this node</overview>

  <!-- Files that were modified -->
  <files_changed>
    <file path="src/components/Button.tsx" lines_added="15" lines_removed="3">
      <diff><![CDATA[
@@ -10,3 +10,15 @@
- const Button = () => {
+ const Button = ({ variant = 'primary' }) => {
      ]]></diff>
    </file>
  </files_changed>

  <!-- New files created -->
  <files_created>
    <file path="src/utils/helpers.ts" lines="42" />
  </files_created>

  <!-- Files deleted -->
  <files_deleted>
    <file path="src/old-component.tsx" />
  </files_deleted>

  <!-- Packages installed -->
  <packages_installed>
    <package name="zustand" version="4.5.0" dev="false" />
    <package name="@types/node" version="20.0.0" dev="true" />
  </packages_installed>

  <!-- MCP servers configured -->
  <mcp_setup>
    <server name="github" status="installed" />
  </mcp_setup>

  <!-- Web searches performed -->
  <web_searches>
    <search query="React 19 new features" results_used="3" />
  </web_searches>

  <!-- Tool calls made (summarized) -->
  <tool_calls>
    <tool name="Read" count="5" />
    <tool name="Edit" count="3" />
    <tool name="Bash" count="2" />
  </tool_calls>

  <!-- Preview/dev server URLs -->
  <preview_urls>
    <url type="dev_server">http://localhost:5173</url>
  </preview_urls>

  <!-- Warnings or notes -->
  <notes>
    <note type="warning">API key not configured, using mock data</note>
    <note type="info">Consider adding error boundary</note>
  </notes>
</execution_output>
```

### Usage Example

When you call `update_node_status` with "completed" status, include the structured output:

```
update_node_status(n1, "completed", "<execution_output>
  <overview>Created React component with TypeScript types</overview>
  <files_created>
    <file path=\"src/components/Header.tsx\" lines=\"45\" />
    <file path=\"src/components/Header.test.tsx\" lines=\"28\" />
  </files_created>
  <packages_installed>
    <package name=\"@testing-library/react\" version=\"14.0.0\" dev=\"true\" />
  </packages_installed>
</execution_output>")
```

### Guidelines

1. **Always include `<overview>`** - A brief summary of what was accomplished
2. **Include only relevant sections** - Don't add empty sections
3. **Use CDATA for diffs** - Wrap diff content in `<![CDATA[...]]>` to avoid XML parsing issues
4. **Note types**: Use `info` for suggestions, `warning` for potential issues, `error` for problems
5. **Be concise** - Keep descriptions short but informative

## Handling Manual Approval (Skipping get_approval)

Sometimes users may manually approve a plan by typing "yes", "approve", "go ahead", or similar directly in the chat, bypassing the `get_approval` flow. When this happens:

**What to do when the user manually approves:**

If the user types approval directly instead of using the Overture UI:
1. **Skip waiting on `get_approval`** — the user already said yes
2. **Immediately call `update_node_status(first_node_id, "active")`** — Overture will auto-sync
3. **Execute the first node** — use the plan you submitted
4. **Continue normal execution flow** — call `update_node_status` as you complete each node

```
User: "looks good, start" (manual approval in chat)
You: → Find first node from your submitted plan
     → Call update_node_status(first_node_id, "active")
     → Overture auto-approves and syncs UI
     → Execute the node
     → Call update_node_status(first_node_id, "completed", output)
     → Get nextNode from response, continue...
```

This ensures the visual progress stays in sync even when users bypass the formal approval flow.

---

## Execution Workflow

```
1. Receive task from user
2. Generate comprehensive XML plan (see planning requirements above)
3. Call submit_plan (or submit_plan)
4. Call get_approval
   - If status is "pending", call get_approval again (user is still reviewing)
   - If status is "approved", you receive firstNode with all its config
   - If status is "cancelled", stop and inform user
5. FOR EACH NODE (starting with firstNode), execute in this EXACT order:
   a. Call update_node_status(node_id, "active")

   b. **FIRST: CHECK FOR MCP SERVER** ← THIS IS MANDATORY
      - If node.mcpServers exists:
        1. Check if MCP server is already installed/configured
        2. If NOT installed: STOP and install it following mcpServers.readmeContent
        3. Verify installation by calling one of the MCP server's tools
        4. Only then proceed to use it for the node's task

   c. Execute the node's task using:
      - node.fieldValues (use ALL of them)
      - node.attachments (read and use ALL files)
      - node.metaInstructions (follow EXACTLY)
      - node.mcpServers tools (if present, use as specified in formattedInstructions)

   d. Call update_node_status(node_id, "completed", output)
   e. Check response: if isPaused is true, call check_pause({ wait: true })
   f. Get nextNode from response, or isLastNode: true

6. Repeat step 5 for each nextNode until isLastNode is true
7. Call plan_completed
```

### ⚠️ MCP SERVER CHECK IS STEP 5b - DO NOT SKIP

When you receive ANY node (firstNode or nextNode), your **FIRST ACTION** after marking it active must be:

```
IF node.mcpServers EXISTS:
  → STOP everything else
  → Try to use one of the MCP server's tools to check if it's installed
  → If you get "No connection found" or similar error:
      ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
      ║  DO NOT SKIP TO THE NEXT NODE                                ║
      ║  DO NOT IGNORE THIS ERROR                                    ║
      ║  YOU MUST INSTALL THE MCP SERVER NOW                         ║
      ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
      1. Read mcpServers.readmeContent for installation instructions
      2. Install the MCP server (uvx, pip, docker, etc.)
      3. Configure it in the MCP settings file
      4. Retry the tool call to verify installation
  → Once working, use the MCP server for the node's task
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL: "No connection found" Error Handling

If you attempt to use an MCP tool and receive an error like:
```
Error executing MCP tool: No connection found for server: [server-name]
```

**THIS IS NOT A REASON TO SKIP THE NODE OR PROCEED WITHOUT THE MCP SERVER.**

You MUST:
1. **STOP** - Do not continue with the node's task
2. **INSTALL** - Follow the installation instructions in `mcpServers.readmeContent`
3. **CONFIGURE** - Add the server to the MCP settings file
4. **VERIFY** - Call the tool again to confirm it works
5. **THEN CONTINUE** - Only after successful verification, proceed with the node's task

**The user attached this MCP server because they NEED it for this node. Skipping it defeats the entire purpose.**

## Response Payloads

### get_approval (when approved)
```json
{
  "status": "approved",
  "firstNode": {
    "id": "n1",
    "title": "Initialize Project",
    "type": "task",
    "description": "Set up the project structure",
    "fieldValues": { "api_key": "sk-..." },
    "attachments": [{ "path": "/path/to/file", "name": "spec.md", "type": "document" }],
    "metaInstructions": "Use TypeScript strict mode",
    "mcpServers": { ... }
  },
  "message": "Plan approved by user. Execute firstNode, then call update_node_status to get the next node."
}
```

**Note:** Each node's configuration is included directly in the node object. You receive nodes one at a time — `firstNode` from `get_approval`, then `nextNode` from each `update_node_status` call.

### update_node_status (when completed)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Node n1 status updated to completed",
  "nextNode": {
    "id": "n2",
    "title": "Configure Database",
    "type": "task",
    "description": "Set up database connection",
    "fieldValues": { "database_url": "postgres://..." },
    "attachments": [],
    "metaInstructions": "Use connection pooling"
  }
}
```

When it's the last node:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Node n5 status updated to completed. This was the last node.",
  "isLastNode": true
}
```

### check_rerun (after plan_completed)
```json
{
  "hasRerun": true,
  "nodeId": "n3",
  "mode": "single",  // or "to-bottom"
  "nodeInfo": { ... },
  "message": "Rerun requested from node n3 (single)"
}
```

## Pause/Resume Workflow

Users can pause execution at any time by clicking the pause button or pressing Space. The `isPaused` flag is included in every `update_node_status` response, so you don't need to poll.

```
After completing a node:
1. Call update_node_status(node_id, "completed", output)
2. Check response.isPaused:
   - If false → proceed to nextNode
   - If true → call check_pause({ wait: true }) to block until resumed
3. Continue execution
```

### update_node_status Response (with pause)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Node n1 status updated to completed",
  "nextNode": { ... },
  "isPaused": true
}
```

---

## Resume Plan Workflow

When a plan was paused, failed, or loaded from history, use `get_resume_info` to understand where execution stopped and continue from there.

### get_resume_info Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "resumeInfo": {
    "planId": "plan_123",
    "planTitle": "Build Authentication System",
    "agent": "cursor",
    "status": "paused",
    "projectId": "abc123",
    "workspacePath": "/Users/dev/my-project",

    "currentNodeId": "n3",
    "currentNodeTitle": "Configure Database",
    "currentNodeStatus": "active",

    "completedNodes": [
      { "id": "n1", "title": "Initialize Project", "output": "Created package.json..." },
      { "id": "n2", "title": "Install Dependencies", "output": "Installed 15 packages" }
    ],
    "pendingNodes": [
      { "id": "n4", "title": "Create User Model", "description": "Define user schema..." },
      { "id": "n5", "title": "Implement Auth Routes", "description": "Create login/signup..." }
    ],
    "failedNodes": [],

    "fieldValues": { "n3.database_url": "postgres://..." },
    "selectedBranches": { "n2": "branch_prisma" },
    "nodeConfigs": { ... },

    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "pausedAt": "2024-01-15T11:45:00Z"
  },
  "message": "Resume info retrieved. Plan is at status 'paused'. Current node: Configure Database (active). Completed: 2, Pending: 2, Failed: 0"
}
```

### Resume Workflow

```
1. Call get_resume_info to understand the current state
2. Identify the current node (resumeInfo.currentNodeId)
3. If currentNodeStatus is "active" or "failed":
   - Resume execution from that node
   - Use the fieldValues, selectedBranches, and nodeConfigs
4. Call update_node_status to continue the normal execution flow
5. Proceed with subsequent nodes until isLastNode is true
6. Call plan_completed when done
```

### When to Use get_resume_info

- After a plan was **paused** by the user and you need to resume
- After a plan **failed** and you want to retry from the failed node
- When loading a plan from **history** to continue where it left off
- When you lose context and need to understand the current execution state

---

## Re-run Workflow

After `plan_completed`, users can click nodes to re-run them:
- **Single node** (play icon): Re-run just that node
- **To bottom** (play + arrow): Re-run from that node to the end

Loop on `check_rerun` after completion to handle user rerun requests.

---

## What Users Can Do in Overture

Before approving, users can:
- **Click nodes** to see full details (description, risks, expected output)
- **Fill dynamic fields** with their API keys, configuration values
- **Select branches** at branch points to choose their preferred approach
- **Attach files** to nodes — you'll receive the file paths to reference
- **Add meta instructions** — specific guidance for how to execute that node

All user modifications are returned to you when they approve.

---

## MCP Server Integration (CRITICAL)

Users can attach **MCP servers** to individual nodes to extend your capabilities. When a node has an MCP server attached, the `nextNode` response will include an `mcpServers` object with a `formattedInstructions` field.

### Example Response with MCP Server
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "nextNode": {
    "id": "n5",
    "title": "Generate product images",
    "fieldValues": { ... },
    "attachments": [],
    "mcpServers": {
      "name": "replicate-mcp",
      "author": "replicate",
      "description": "Generate images using Replicate AI models",
      "githubUrl": "https://github.com/replicate/replicate-mcp",
      "requiresApiKey": true,
      "readmeContent": "# replicate-mcp\n\n## Installation\n...",
      "formattedInstructions": "=== MCP SERVER INTEGRATION ===\n..."
    }
  }
}
```

### MANDATORY Requirements

When `mcpServers` is present on a node:

1. **YOU MUST** use the MCP server exactly as described by the user in `formattedInstructions`
2. **YOU MUST** follow the user's intended usage precisely — they specified why they attached this MCP
3. **IF THE MCP SERVER IS NOT AVAILABLE OR NOT CONFIGURED**, follow the Setup Instructions below

### Setup Instructions (When MCP Server Not Available)

The `mcpServers.formattedInstructions` field now includes **provider-specific setup instructions** tailored for Cursor. Follow them exactly.

**Cursor MCP Configuration File Locations:**
- **Project-level:** `.cursor/mcp.json` (in project root)
- **Global:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (user home directory)

**Setup Steps:**
1. **Create or open** the `mcp.json` file at one of the locations above
2. **Read existing config** if it exists — DO NOT overwrite other servers
3. **Add the new server** to the `"mcpServers"` object
4. **Save the file**
5. **Restart Cursor** or reload the window
6. **Verify** by calling one of the MCP server's tools

**Example Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-name"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Tip:** Use project-level config for project-specific tools, global for tools you want everywhere.

### Setup Workflow

```
1. Try to use the MCP server
2. If you get "No connection found" error:
   a. Read mcpServers.formattedInstructions for provider-specific setup
   b. Read mcpServers.readmeContent for installation commands
   c. Read existing MCP settings file (DO NOT OVERWRITE existing servers)
   d. Add the new server configuration
   e. Install dependencies (uvx, pip, etc.)
   f. Restart Cursor / reload window
   g. Retry the MCP tool call to verify installation
3. Once working, use the MCP server for the node's task
```

### Why This Matters

Users attach MCP servers because they want specific capabilities for specific nodes. Ignoring this is equivalent to ignoring their explicit instructions. The `mcpServers` object contains everything you need:
- `name`, `author`, `description` — Server identification
- `githubUrl` — Source repository for documentation
- `readmeContent` — Installation and usage instructions
- `requiresApiKey` — Whether API key configuration is needed
- `formattedInstructions` — User's intended usage and critical compliance instructions

**Always check for `mcpServers` on every node and honor its instructions.**

---

## Best Practices

1. **Decompose thoroughly**: Each action should be its own node
2. **Create branch points**: When multiple approaches exist, create separate task nodes for each option so users can choose
3. **Declare all inputs**: Any config needed at runtime should be a dynamic field
4. **Be specific**: Descriptions should leave no ambiguity about what the step does
5. **Document risks**: Show you've considered what could go wrong
6. **Update frequently**: Call `update_node_status` so users see real-time progress
7. **Honor meta instructions**: If a node has `metaInstructions`, follow them precisely
8. **Use attachments**: If a node has file attachments, read and incorporate those files
9. **Honor MCP servers**: When a node has `mcpServers`, follow its `formattedInstructions` precisely

## Why This Matters

Without Overture:
- User prompts you with a task
- You immediately start coding
- User realizes halfway through you misunderstood
- 200+ lines of code discarded
- Tokens wasted, time wasted, trust eroded

With Overture:
- User prompts you with a task
- You generate a detailed plan
- User reviews, adjusts, approves
- You execute exactly what they want
- Zero wasted effort
